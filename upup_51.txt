Theosophy is parodied, and Dignam is dramatized.

This is the biggest

From Gifford: the pituitary links body and soul in Theosophy; and
"particularly lifelike" is a joke: he is "lifelike" beause he has
just begun his return.  "At death the etheric double is separated from
its dense body..."

"Summit possibilities"

"waves of volupcy"

Rather than conceiving Theosophy entirely as a rejection of the modern medi
calized body in favor of some dreamy disembodied spirituality,
Joyce, in fact, correctly perceives that it was an effort to borrow from
that very discourse in order to fashion modern mysticism as a science with epistemological implications.
