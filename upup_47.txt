It is seen that Bloom is well known, enough to have "prudent member"
derisively applied to him and immediately understood.  We've seen him
thru other eyes -- in Hades, "a coon like that" and Lenehan, who tells
M'Coy: "He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s
not one of your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the
artist about old Bloom."  He's always looked down on/regarded as
other for Jewishness.

There is a brief "high written" interruption in this section, that is
"Who comes through Michan's land".  An aside about those interruptions
in general:

  * the main narrator gives the impression of spontaneous speech,
whereas the interruptions, whether about boxing matches, agricultural
bounty, or executions, are elaborately and self-consciously written.

  * The interruptions are incessantly positive, exalting, praising whatever comes to attention -- decapitation, an enormous nostril; while the "aye says
I" narrator is constantly belittling. Calling Hyne's coin "goodlooking"
is the most postive comment he has to make.

(NY Times was called "the old gray lady", is this a general theme
for newspapers?)

Page-by-page mentions earlier drafts, http://www.jjda.ie/main/JJDA/U/ulex/n/n1A1d.htm, which has a fragment describing bloom wandering thru stinking
gutted fish and fishgirls.


remarkable words:

blue mouldy  [Green's](https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/tf23j6i#xke3gcy) gives "blue mouldy for a fight" like "spoiling for a fight" -- on-edge-for

bedight -- adorned

land out  Green uses "land out" like "land a punch", which could vaguely
resembling putting out money.  It also sounds somewhat nautical, perhaps
recalling the Cyclops imagery; in Padraic Colum's Homer for Children,
there's a double landing, first they land on a waste island, then they
come over to the Cyclopes's island, and the landing is described with a
little detail to the reader; and Odysseus subsequently tells Polyphemus
that he didn't land his ship but crashed on the rocks.

sloping -- word choice, makes bloom seem shifty, and indeed he was
sneaking to the post office likely not wanting to be see.
