We've had a few of these interruptions now and can say:  The "Aye said I" narrator
is the most conventional, flowing presentation in Ulysses so far; it's like someone
talking spontaneouly to an audience.

It's interrupted with grand-style elaborately written, more-or-less
hackneyed, sometimes cliche-choked passages.

The interruptions are incessantly positive, exalting, praising whatever comes
to attention -- decapitation, an enormous nostril.

The boxing match and Dignam back from the dead are the best interruptions.
