The narrator and Joe Hynes comes into the bar.  Joe's a newspaperman,
the narrator seems to have fallen, perhaps from a police job, do becoming
a debt collector.  At any rate he's able to talke with "Troy from The DMP"

"So we turned into" -- don't ignore the obvious jokes; the transmution of
chartacter into scene.  Narrative spellmaking: Joyce turns these two to a
