Chucking out the rhino -- Alf pays for himself, Joe doesn't offer;
maybe that's just normal protocol if you buy mid round

A bundle of wisps -- Skeat says it would be regular for it to arise
out of "wips" but that "wips" doesn't occur. It just means a small
bundle of straw or hay; a related Swed. word *vipp* is a little bundle
or sheaf.  The word probably has its origin (says Skeat) in wag, jerk,
"move briskly to and fro".   Ngrams shows no similar usage

Alf just saw him with Willy Murray and Doran wakes up and starts
calling Paddy "Willy" -- so I wonder if there's a "the Willies"
joke in there.
