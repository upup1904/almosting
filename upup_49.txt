Summary: Dolan starts to wake up, hearing Alf talking about hanging;
then a fulsome narrative praises beer, Terry, Alf, and Queen Victoria.

Money continues its prominent place: adding hilarity to Breen's distress
is the sum of money he seeks.  The coin bearing Victoria's picture
occasions a paean to her.  Themes: Colonialism and just possibly
Domineering Women.

Iveah -- An earlship created for Arthur Guiness; Already the First
Barnon of Ardilaun.  "Bung"+Iveah, "Bung"+Ardilaun; Joyce [wrote  for a paper owned by 
Lord Ardlaun's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Guinness,_1st_Baron_Ardilaun#In_%22Ulysses%22)

The back and forth conversation is good hereabouts -- UPUP 48, 49 and
50, but gets broken up when split into these little parts. People in
the bar don't hear answers, or don't answer quests (like "'What's that?', say Joe" gets no
answer)  Aye-says-I seems to be a good transcriptionist.

Historically, the Kiernan collected memorabilia of crimes and
executions, which would explain from a realist perspective why it
might come up here.  But that collection isn't in evidence here, and
no other souveniers are mentioned.  So why is Joyce bringing it up?
It's in proximity to Dignam's apparition.  It also gives the occasion,
in a few pages, for an airily enthusiastic account of an execution;
it two distinct ways the chapter is merrily babbling about
death

Mountjoy is a prison, founded in 1950.  The name probably is chosen
to couple a pleasant name with mounting the scaffold for execution.

"Cunning as the sons of deathless Leda," that would be  Castor and Pollux.
It seems they were outwitted blunderers from what I read in wikipedia.b

Why does Alf get a small beer, is it because he arrived between rounds and doesn't
want to lay out money til he sees if someone else is buying?
