Summary: Alf comes into Barney's laughing about Breen.


Gave him an eye as a good as a process -- Breen must have come sputtering
up to Long John Fanning, subsherrif, who returned a contemptuous stare,
and Breen went on to get a policeman -- is that what "G Man" is?  The
expression "eye as good as a process", means Long John stared at him
with a glare that would signal as much trouble as delivering a legal
document to him?  

In note 10.893 Gifford notes subsherrif was the real sherrif, and the
high sherrif was an honorary position.

Is Breen with the two giant books of law a Moses parody?

Great line: "the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting
like a poodle"

"eye"-dulterations: "radiant as the eye of heaven", "eye good as a process"


remarkable words:

squeezed up/split/doubled -- later, in Circe, Alf is again "doubled"
with laughing at Bergnan.

Here "squeezed up with the laughing" that "the" pushes the expression
toward stage Irish.

In line with the later "doubled up" -- "I thought Alf would split"


oxter  armpit

pantaloon -- can mean loose-fitting or tight-fitting; here I wonder if
narrator has the word "poltroon" in mind, a poltroon is a coward.

G man

*Bi i dho husht* -- this is a mangling of irish, so people take it to
signal that the Citizen is not so up on his Irish as he wants to seem.
*Bí i do thost* sounds about like husht.
